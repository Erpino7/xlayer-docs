# Get testnet tokens

There are currently two ways for users and developers to receive OKB testnet tokens on X Layer.
- Use the X Layer official testnet faucet (max of 0.2 OKB) [here](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/faucet "faucet").
- [Mint on Sepolia testnet](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/faucet/sepoliafaucet "sepolia faucet") and bridge the tokens to X Layer using the [testnet bridge](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/bridge-test "testnet bridge") (no limit to amount of OKB).

In this guide, we will show the steps on how to receive OKB testnet.

## X Layer official testnet faucet
The X Layer [testnet faucet](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/faucet "faucet") is an official tool provided by the X Layer team for developers to claim test tokens. Developers and users can use X Layer testnet faucet to obtain:
- Testnet OKB tokens 
- Other ERC-20 tokens

<Tip title="Note">
Please note that on the X Layer testnet, each user can only claim 0.2 OKB per day.
</Tip>

1. Head to the X Layer testnet faucet and click on the Get button for the "Get OKB from X Layer testnet" option.

## Mint via Sepolia and bridge testnet OKB

Users and developers can also mint testnet OKB on the Sepolia testnet and use the official X Layer [bridge](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/bridge-test "testnet bridge") to bridge OKB. You can also bridge other testnet tokens from Sepolia to the X Layer testnet. To simplify the minting process of testnet OKB on Sepolia testnet, we have also provided the interface to do so through our X Layer testnet faucet [here](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/faucet "faucet").

<Tip title="Note">
Please ensure that your wallet contains enough ETH (Sepolia ETH) for gas fees on the Sepolia network. You can also use the X Layer bridge to bridge ETH to the X Layer testnet.
</Tip>


1. Go to the X Layer testnet faucet official website and click the Get button for the "Mint OKB on Sepolia" option.
