# Account abstraction

`Account abstraction` is a broad category of fast-moving development in the Ethereum ecosystem. It generally refers to different ways to create and manage accounts, other than using a Secret Recovery Phrase and a wallet.

One milestone in this area was the inclusion of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337 "eip4337") in the Ethereum protocol.

This includes, but is not limited to:

Creating accounts using a cryptographic library running in a dapp (an "embedded wallet")
The creation of an account that is to some degree controlled by a smart contract
That second point may seem small, but it enables things like:

Account Recovery ("social recovery", recovery via email or other identities or accounts)
Use case-specific limitations
Paying for a user's gas fees
Delegation of assets
and a lot more.

As a network, X Layer is heavily invested in innovating in the account abstraction space; consult the resources here to see how you can implement the tools we already have... and then build your own.
