# Node providers
Node providers are fundamental to the blockchain ecosystem, offering the infrastructure needed to connect to and interact with blockchain networks. These services, including ZAN and Ankr, provide scalable and reliable access to blockchain nodes, enabling developers to build and maintain decentralized applications (dApps) without the need to manage their own nodes.
X Layer is dedicated to supporting and advancing the capabilities of node providers. Explore our resources to learn how you can leverage these services to streamline your development process and build robust blockchain applications.
