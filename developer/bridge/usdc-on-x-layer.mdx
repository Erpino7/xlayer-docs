# USDC on X Layer

![USDC workflow](./img/usdc.png)

## The difference between USDC and USDC.e

## USDC
Circle brings USDC natively to new blockchain networks to empower developers to build on a stable foundation they can trust. Native USDC is officially issued by Circle. [Native USDC is now available on the other Layer 2](https://www.circle.com/blog/native-usdc-now-available-on-zksync "Native USDC").

|Asset|X Layer mainnet address|
|:----|:----|
|USDC|0x74b7f16337b8972027f6196a17a631ac6de26d22|

## USDC.e
There also exists a “bridged” form of USDC known as USDC.e, which is USDC that has been bridged from Ethereum. Bridged USDC (USDC.e) is not issued by Circle.

## Using USDC on X Layer

<Tip title="Note">Whether you are a developer or a user, we recommend that you use **USDC on X Layer**.</Tip>

## For users
Users can get USDC on the X Layer mainnet in these ways:

1. Using X Layer official bridge

When you bridge USDC from Ethereum to the X Layer by [official bridge user interface](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/bridge "XLayer bridge"), you can automatically receive USDC on the X Layer.

2. Using OKX exchange

[OKX](https://www.okx.com/ "OKX") now supports USDC (not USDC.e) deposits and withdrawals.

3. Using third-party bridges

Some well known bridges are integrating with X Layers. 

## For developers
Please refer to the USDC workflow section.
